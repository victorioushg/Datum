      <p>The MICR E13B font is a special font that is used on bank
        checks and drafts in the United States, Canada, Puerto
        Rico, Panama, UK, and a few other countries to print MICR
        characters for magnetic recognition and optical character
        recognition systems. The MICR E13B font contains ten
        specially designed numeric characters 0 through 9, and
        the four special symbols: transit, amount, on-us, and
        dash. The MICR CMC-7 font is a special font that is used
        on bank checks in Mexico, France, Spain and most Spanish
        speaking countries. For information on the CMC-7 font <a
        href="http://www.bizfonts.com/MICR_CMC-7_Font/">visit the
        CMC-7 MICR Font Site</a>.</p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li><b>Created Directly From ISO Specifications</b> - the MICR E13B fonts were created according to ISO (International Standards
        Organization) specifications for  E13B MICR. The MICR
        E13B fonts also comply to strict ABA and ANSI standards
        and have been in use for over three years in Draft Creator and other
      check printing software programs. These MICR fonts have been proven to
        pass the ABA banking standards in the USA for bank checks
        and bank drafts. The MICR fonts have been tested on several MICR readers
      and sorters including the UNISYS DP500 and the IBM 3890.</li>
    <li> <b> Visual Basic Source Code -</b> we now include Visual Basic source code with your order. The VB source
      code has been extracted from a working check printing application and it should give you ideas and guidance
      for automated methods of printing bank checks using our MICR E-13B font.</li>
    <li><b>Peachtree Compatibility</b> - some accounting packages (such as Peachtree Complete Accounting version
      8 or greater) allow the use of our MICR fonts on custom check forms. If
      your accounting package has this capability, you can save on check
      printing and streamline the check printing process.</li>
    <li><b>Easy to use</b> - the following is sample
        code from Visual Basic that selects the MICR font and
        size.<br>
        <font color="#008000" size="2">Printer.FontName =
        &quot;IDAutomationMICR&quot;<br>
        Printer.CurrentX = 1500<br>
        Printer.CurrentY = 3000<br>
        Printer.FontSize = 12 <br>
        Printer.Print&nbsp; <i>variable</i></font></li>
    <li><b>Embedding Support</b> - the embedding support of our MICR fonts enables embedding in special PDF
      document applications such as Adobe Writer, Distiller, PDF Lib and FOP TTF
      Reader. This level of embedding also supports creation of OpenType and
      TrueDoc fonts for webpages. <font size="2"><a href="http://www.bizfonts.com/internetfonts/" target="_blank">More

<p><u><font size="4">The following is a list of known problems that can occur
when printing MICR. In any MICR project, you should verify the following:</font></u></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Verify the correct horizontal and vertical placement of the MICR E13B
    font symbols and their fields.</b>&nbsp; You should compare your MICR font
    output to our MICR font placement guidelines document or obtain the MICR
    Printed Image Specifications from the American Bankers Association. This
    process is simplified if you are using check stock with a light square box
    near the bottom; align the first bank routing or transit symbol in the box.&nbsp;</li>
  <li><b>Verify that you are printing with MICR toner.</b> Some banks now use
    OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read the MICR font line on checks and
    regular laser toner is somewhat magnetic, however, you must use MICR toner
    to conform to the ABA standards. <a href="http://www.micrencodingfonts.com/micrtoner/"><b>Click
    here to view the MICR Toner website</b></a> where you can order MICR toner
    for your printer. If your checks come back from the bank with little white
    slips attached to the bottom of them, then the bank had a problem reading
    the MICR line and if the MICR line was aligned properly, it is usually a
    MICR toner problem.</li>
  <li><b>Character spacing issues</b> - One problem that some have is that
    the MICR font will print about (1 to 2%) wider or narrower on some printers,
    paper and under certain humidity conditions, although this will not usually
    cause a MICR read error. To ensure this does not cause the MICR to get out
    of alignment, programmers should design their software so that the MICR
    fields, such as the transit number and account number, print independently
    instead of one long string of characters. If you are using PCL fonts,
    character spacing can be adjusted by setting the HMI for the printer
    whenever the MICR font is selected. MICR should be printed as close to 8 CPI
    as<img border="0" src="wordpad-micr-adjust.gif" align="right" width="419" height="172">
    possible. If you are using TrueType or PostScript fonts, you may be able to
    &quot;fine tune&quot; your font point size, if your application allows it. In
    the example on the right side, we changed the point size to 12.1 to make the
    font slightly wider. To do this, we selected the MICR font string and then
    entered &quot;12.1&quot; in the font point size window and pressed enter. In
    Visual Basic, the point size can be adjusted within 1/100 of a point by
    changing the FontSize property as in this example, where we needed to make
    the font slightly narrower:<br>
    <font color="#008000" size="2"><b>Printer.FontSize = 11.95</b></font></li>
  <li><b>Irregular character / stroke width errors</b> - if these errors are
    received, try using the bold version of the MICR font instead of the normal
    version. The bold version of the TrueType font is &quot;<b>IDAutomationMICRB10</b>&quot;.
    When reported, this type of issue was the result of strict MICR test
    equipment reports, although this did not cause a MICR read error with bank
    reading equipment, except under conditions when printers were printing
    lighter than normal.</li>
